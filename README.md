### Speech Recognition Overview

The following steps will allow you to set up a system that will allow you to train a machine learning algorithm to classify speech based on emotions.

### Installation and Setup

This process will take a few minutes and requires a good internet connection.

### 1. Install Python Speech Features Library
Follow the directions to install python_speech_features [here](https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features)

### 2. Install PDNN

       * Mac/Linux: ```cd ~/Desktop```
       * Windows: ```cd C:\Users\your-username\Desktop```
  * Use git clone https://github.com/littleowen/Conceptor.git to create a local copy of the repository
